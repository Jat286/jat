GAME STORY<br/><br/>
The Sacred Ma of the Tomobugs was once kept in the three Temples of The Ma in The Jungle. <br/>
While they remained safe, the bugs of t'Honza were happy and well. One fateful day,<br/>
10000 years ago, a dark spirit called EvilZ caused three great calamities in the city <br/>
and in each one he snuck into the temples to steal the sacred pieces of The Ma. You are a <br/>
young Tomobug who is a member of the MaDefenders, a secret group of bugs determined to <br/>
save The Ma. You start your mission by making your way through MaDefenders HQ before<br/>
heading out into the Desert and beyond... Can you save The Ma from EvilZ? No-one knows.<br/><br/>
